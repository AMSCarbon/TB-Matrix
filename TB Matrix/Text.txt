Network TB model.
Author: Aidan McMahon-Smith 

This is the second attempt at an epidemic model for representing the spread antibiotic resistant TB. 


TODO: 
effect of the presence of antibiotic resistance on cure rate/ mutation rate. 
use armidillo c++ or a similar linear algebra library to improve speed.
map for variable population density. 
ask mark about specifying resistances or grouping # of resistances.  
the transition between the resistant states should explicitly change when antibiotics are present/ abscent.
